# evenbrite_test

## Note

This is a working solution for eventbrite's technical assesment. I did not use chatgpt for this. I just googled lodash methods and continued where I left off.

## Installation

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run start
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.3. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
